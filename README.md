This was a research project developed in a short timeframe as an exploration of terminal-based game development. The focus was on implementing basic game mechanics and generating environments using a simplistic application of a randomized DFS algorithm.

Please note that this is a minimalistic project and does not aim to provide a complete and polished game experience.

The library used for the terminal art is [PDCurses](https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses/tree/master).
